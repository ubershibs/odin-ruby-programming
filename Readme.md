##Final Project
###Two-player Chess
The final project for [the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/ruby-final-project)'s Ruby Course. Currently, this is feature complete and my tests are passing, but I've still got quite a bit more manual testing and cleanup to do. You can play by running "chess/main.rb"
